# redis-level

- Redis based [`abstract-level`][abstract-level] database for Node.js.

Requirements:
- redis-2.8 or more recent.
- node-12.x

Uses a sorted-set to order the keys and a hash to store the values.

Fetches the ordered key value pairs during iterations with a single redis lua call.

## Usage

```js
const { RedisLevel } = require('redis-level')

// Create a database
const db = new RedisLevel('tokens', { valueEncoding: 'buffer' })

// Add an entry with key 'a' and value 1
await db.put('a', 1)

// Add multiple entries
await db.batch([{ type: 'put', key: 'b', value: 2 }])

// Get value of key 'a': 1
const value = await db.get('a')

// Iterate entries with keys that are greater than 'a'
for await (const [key, value] of db.iterator({ gt: 'a' })) {
  console.log(value) // 2
}
```

With callbacks:

```js
db.put('example', { hello: 'world' }, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err

  db.get('example', (err, value) => {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(value) // { hello: 'world' }
  })
})
```


## API
The API of `redis-level` follows that of [`abstract-level`](https://github.com/Level/abstract-level) with a few additional options and methods specific to Redis. The documentation below covers it all except for [Encodings](https://github.com/Level/abstract-level#encodings), [Events](https://github.com/Level/abstract-level#events) and [Errors](https://github.com/Level/abstract-level#errors) which are exclusively documented in `abstract-level`.

An `abstract-level` and thus `redis-level` database is at its core a [key-value database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database). A key-value pair is referred to as an _entry_ here and typically returned as an array, comparable to [`Object.entries()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries).

### `db = new RedisLevel(location[, options])`

Returns a new **RedisLevel** instance. `location` is a String pointing at the root namespace of the data in redis.

- `location+':h'` is the hash where the values are stored.
- `location+':z'` is the set where the keys are sorted.

Aside from the basic `abstract-level` options, the optional `options` object may contain:

- `connection` represents the connection parameters, and can be one of the following :
    - an already configured redis client. RedisLevel will not open or close it.
    - a string representing a redis URL
    - options as specified by [ioredis](https://luin.github.io/ioredis/index.html#RedisOptions)
- `highWaterMark` number of values to fetch in one redis call for iteration. Defaults to 256.
- `clearOnOpen` clears the database on open. Defaults to `false`.

The `createIfMissing` option of `abstract-level` is ignored, as this is the way that `redis` works.
